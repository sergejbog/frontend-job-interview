Thought Process

I wanted to make a simple sliding carousel that moves items from right to left. To do this, I used a timer that updates a number called offset every few milliseconds. This number tells how much the items should slide. Once the first item is fully out of view, I move it to the end of the list and reset the sliding to start again. I had to get the width of the first item after everything was on the screen, so I waited for the page to finish loading before measuring it. At first, the items weren’t moving, and I realized it was because I didn’t write the style in a way that would update automatically (dynamic tailwind issue.). After fixing that, the items started sliding smoothly, one after the other.
